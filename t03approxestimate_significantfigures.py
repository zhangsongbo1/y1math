# Craft your question and code your solution ~
# Contributed by V Lew.  Level of difficulty (year 1s) : Basic to Intermediate
#
# Objective -
# Allow student to apply rules to search strings using string functions
# and classify and compute the significant figure of a given number.
# Expect students to use if-then-else and for or while loops to search
# a string, and converting numbers to string and vice versa.
#
# Write Python code to state the number of significant figures of 
# a given number which is a whole number or contains decimal numbers.
# 192, 83.76, 3, 4.5
# 506, 1.099, 3.0021, 70.8001
# 0.10, 0.500, 41.0320, 6.090
# 0.021, 0.603, 0.00173, 0.01090
# 3800, 25000, 103000
#
# Extension: Write Python code that generate questions,
# i.e. numbers and query students about the number of signficant
# figures of the given number, and give feedback to student's answer.
